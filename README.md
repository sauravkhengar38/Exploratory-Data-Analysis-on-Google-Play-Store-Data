# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Play Store Data

**Project Overview:**
In this project, I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset. The main goal was to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and understand the structure and characteristics of mobile applications available on the platform.

**Objectives:**
- Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
- Analyze app categories, ratings, installs, and pricing structures.
- Identify the most popular app categories and top-performing apps.
- Explore the relationship between app size, rating, reviews, and price.
- Visualize key findings with informative charts and graphs.

**Key Steps Taken:**
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Removed duplicate entries and handled missing/incorrect values.
  - Converted data types for appropriate analysis (e.g., installs, prices).
- **Data Exploration:**  
  - Analyzed distributions of ratings, reviews, and installs.
  - Examined the frequency and popularity of different app categories.
- **Insights Extraction:**  
  - Found which categories have the highest average ratings.
  - Identified top apps based on number of installs and user reviews.
  - Compared free vs. paid apps across different metrics.
- **Visualization:**  
  - Used histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and bar charts to present findings.
  - Created category-wise app count plots and price distributions.

**Key Findings:**
- Most apps on the Play Store are free, but paid apps tend to have slightly higher ratings.
- Games and Productivity apps are among the most downloaded.
- High number of installs doesnâ€™t always correlate with higher ratings.
- App size doesnâ€™t significantly influence user rating but impacts downloads in some categories.

**Tools & Libraries Used:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation

**Conclusion:**
Through this EDA, I was able to uncover hidden patterns and important factors that contribute to an appâ€™s success on the Google Play Store. These insights can be highly valuable for developers, marketers, and data-driven decision-making.
